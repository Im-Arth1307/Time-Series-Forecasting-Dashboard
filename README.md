# Project Silent Talks

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using machine learning models like XGBoost and LightGBM. Built using Python and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn, it provides insights into trends and predictions using historical time series data.

## Features

- Forecasting using XGBoost and LightGBM
- Visualization of original and predicted time series
- Performance evaluation using MSE and other metrics
- Easily extensible for other datasets or models


## Tech Stack

- **Python**

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for train-test splitting and evaluation  
- **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** for forecasting models

## Project Structure
```bash
